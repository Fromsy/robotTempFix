# robotTempFix
temporary fix made to fix a bunch of issues, still lots of work needed. Why is it by its-self? because it was a temp solution to get around the issue we were having with putting downloaded files into eclipse, and a lot is wrong with it so we might just want to redesign it and start from a previous point.
